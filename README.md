# mail_server
* The mail service on any mail server has three components:

Mail user agent (MUA): this component that the user sees and interacts with like Thunderbird and Microsoft Outlook, these user agents are responsible for reading mail and allowing you to compose mail.

Mail transport agent (MTA): this component is responsible for getting the mail from one site to another like Sendmail and Postfix.

Mail delivery agent (MDA): this component is responsible for distributing received messages on the local machine to the appropriate user mailbox like postfix-maildrop and Procmail.
